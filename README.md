### _**IMPORTANT NOTES**_ - 
This project does not have a mongoDB connection setup.
- local development: create a config file (make sure to name it config.js) in the config folder, which exports your db.uri connection. An example is provided, config/config.example.js. This file will be ignored by git so your db credentials will be kept safe when the app is deployed.


## Getting Started
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application with a solid file structure as a foundation.

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root. After this you will run `npm run-script install-all` from the root. From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json. Alternatively your group may choose to simplify this process by using yarn workspaces as specified [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).

This app can be deployed directly to your local since there is a script defined in package.json which will automatically handle building and deploying the app.


## Available Scripts

Please note that any time the server is run in these scripts `nodemon` is used in place of `node` for easier development. If you are interested in how this works follow the nodemon In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn workspace server dev`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `yarn workspace client start`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `yarn workspace server start`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `yarn workspace server build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
